# CostToGoReaching

Code for simulating reaching movements in presence of dynamic environments (switch in target structure or online decision to change target goal). 

## Dependencies
### Matlab toolboxes
 * Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

## File information

The *Simulations* folder contains the code that simulates movements in presence of switch in target structure (ScriptTargetStructure.m) and online decisions to change target goal (ScriptDMOneState.m). These code use the functions contained in the *utils* folder. 


## Reference

This code is a part of research article titled :"Continuous evaluation of the cost-to-go for flexible reaching control and online decisions"
